This is a repository showing how two integers are added through Python.

this is possible through asking the user for input which is shown in the code

num1 = int(prompt("Please input the value of the first integer here: "))
and
num2 = int(prompt("Please input the value of the second integer here: ))

and adding them through adding a new variable with the command

sum = num1+num2

which in turns adds the two integers together. Calling out or printing out this code
allows the user to see the code through

print("The Summation of the two integers", num1, "and", num2 , "is", sum).
